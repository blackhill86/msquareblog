I'm an Assistant Professor at the Psychology and Child Development
Department. I focus my research ideas in problems related to
quantitative psychology. I'm always doing research on latent variable
modeling. I applied my passion for statistics in topics related to
healthy aging and dementia.

When I'm not doing something dorky, I enjoy hiking with my lovely wife
and my dog. I used to play guitar and bass guitar, but academia is a
place of many projects.
