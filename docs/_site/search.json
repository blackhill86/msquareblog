    "text": "I’m an Assistant Professor at the Psychology and Child Development Department. I focus my research ideas in problems related to quantitative psychology. I’m always doing research on latent variable modeling. I applied my passion for statistics in topics related to healthy aging and dementia.\nWhen I’m not doing something dorky, I enjoy hiking with my lovely wife and my dog. I used to play guitar and bass guitar, but academia is a place of many projects."

    "text": "What is invariance testing?\nWhen asking questions about differences between groups or modeling longitudinal data we need to test if our indicators are equivalent. Why again? Because we work with latent variables, and these type of variables are not exactly present in your data set. They are built on assumptions made by the model, hence we need to test our assumptions and beliefs.\nThis is also true for other types of statistical models, but in the case of SEM is specially important due to the presence of implicit variables.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
