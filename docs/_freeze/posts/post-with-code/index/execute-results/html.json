But why? Because it is a popular topic and\nI get to answer the same questions all over again. This made me think,\nthat probably the first post should be about this topic.\n\n## What is invariance testing?\n\nWhen asking questions about differences between groups or \nmodeling longitudinal data we need to test if our\nindicators are equivalent. Why again? Because we work \nwith latent variables, and these type of variables are not\nexactly present in your data set. They are built on assumptions\nmade by the model, hence we need to test our assumptions and beliefs.\n\nThis is also true for other types of statistical models, but in the\ncase of SEM is specially important due to the presence of *implicit* \nvariables. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
